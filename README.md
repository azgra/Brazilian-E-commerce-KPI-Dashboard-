## Overview

This dashboard provides a clear view of key performance indicators (KPIs) for e-commerce. It utilizes MySQL 8 for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), along with feature derivation and window-function KPIs. Tableau handles the visualization, allowing users to drill down into revenue, orders, returns, categories, and states. The entire setup can be reproduced with just two shell commands and requires only 20 MB of CSV files.
